# deploy-deploy Roadman

ChatGPT got it all figured out: *"It sounds like you're excited about deploying your Ansible Collection for GitOps-based deployment workflows! Ansible is a powerful tool for automation, and using it to manage deployments via systemd units is a common and effective approach. Here's a general outline of how you might structure your Ansible Collection to achieve this. By following these steps, you can create a robust and opinionated Ansible Collection for deploying GitOps-based workflows with systemd units. Good luck with your deployment endeavors!"*

1. **Collection Structure**: Organize your Ansible Collection in a way that makes sense for your project. This might include directories for roles, playbooks, plugins, etc.

2. **Ansible Roles**: Create Ansible roles for each component of your deployment workflow. For example:
   - A role for setting up systemd units.
   - A role for configuring GitOps repositories.
   - A role for managing deployment routines (e.g., ansible-pull or shell scripts).

3. **Playbooks**: Write playbooks that orchestrate the deployment process using the roles you've defined. These playbooks will define the sequence of tasks to execute during deployment.

4. **Systemd Units**: Include systemd unit files as templates within your Ansible Collection. These templates can be populated with variables to customize the deployment routines as needed.

5. **Variables**: Define variables to make your deployment process configurable. This might include variables for Git repository URLs, branch names, deployment paths, etc.

6. **Documentation**: Provide thorough documentation to guide users through the deployment process using your Ansible Collection. This should include instructions for configuring variables, executing playbooks, and troubleshooting common issues.

7. **Testing**: Implement automated testing to ensure the reliability and stability of your Ansible Collection. This might include unit tests, integration tests, and validation tests for different deployment scenarios.

8. **Versioning and Distribution**: Use a version control system like Git to manage your Ansible Collection codebase, and consider distributing it via Ansible Galaxy or another package manager for easy consumption by others.

9. **Community Engagement**: Foster a community around your Ansible Collection by soliciting feedback, accepting contributions, and providing support to users.
